Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighbouring mines in each field.
Every button on the minesweeper board can either be unturned, or marked as a flag.
If the user un-turns a mine or marks all of the mines as flags, the game ends.
Every unturned button on the board holds a number, which represents the number of neighbouring mines.
If the number of neighbouring mines for the unturned button is zero, all its neighbours are unturned as well.
